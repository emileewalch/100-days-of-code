# 100 DAYS OF CODE - LOG

## DAY 0/100: January 15, 2019 (Tuesday)

### **TODAY'S PROGRESS:**
I decided to participate in the 100 Days of Code challenge.

### **THOUGHTS:**
In the spirit of learning in 2019, I have decided to commit to the 100 Days of Code challenge. I am going to try to stick to everything largely as instructed but will be modifying a few things here or there to fit my schedule and current workflow.

I'm starting this brand spanking new with no experience other than some HTML email coding and Wordpress custom CSS experience. My goals are to understand the foundations of front end web development and build my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript over the next 100 days. I want to take on both entry point projects for beginners, invest time in reading materials and resources to help build my understanding, and work on certifications that will push me to learn more over time.

The first things I am going to try to tackle in an hour a day are courses/certifications from The Odin Project and Free Code Camp outlined below:

**The Odin Project - Web Development 101**
- [ ] The Basics
- [ ] Installation
- [ ] Git Basics
- [ ] The Front End
- [ ] Javascript Basics
- [ ] The Back End
- [ ] Web Development Basics
- [ ] Pair Programming
- [ ] Tying it All Together
	
**Free Code Camp - Responsive Web Design Certification**
- [ ] Basic HTML and HTML5
- [ ] Basic CSS
- [ ] Applied Visual Design
- [ ] Applied Accessibility
- [ ] Responsive Web Design Principles
- [ ] CSS Flexbox
- [ ] CSS Grid
- [ ] Responsive Web Design Projects
	
I'll be kicking this off likely next week to ensure that I'm set up for success and being able to dedicate time to this on a daily basis. Excited about what's to come!
