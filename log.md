# 100 DAYS OF CODE - LOG

## DAY 0/100: January 15, 2019 (Tuesday)

### **TODAY'S PROGRESS:**
I decided to participate in the 100 Days of Code challenge.

### **THOUGHTS:**
In the spirit of learning in 2019, I have decided to commit to the 100 Days of Code challenge. I am going to try to stick to everything largely as instructed but will be modifying a few things here or there to fit my schedule and current workflow.

I'm starting this brand spanking new with no experience other than some HTML email coding and Wordpress custom CSS experience. My goals are to understand the foundations of front end web development and build my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript over the next 100 days. I want to take on both entry point projects for beginners, invest time in reading materials and resources to help build my understanding, and work on certifications that will push me to learn more over time.

The first things I am going to try to tackle in an hour a day are courses/certifications from The Odin Project and Free Code Camp outlined below:

**The Odin Project - Web Development 101**
- [ ] The Basics
- [ ] Installation
- [ ] Git Basics
- [ ] The Front End
- [ ] Javascript Basics
- [ ] The Back End
- [ ] Web Development Basics
- [ ] Pair Programming
- [ ] Tying it All Together
	
**Free Code Camp - Responsive Web Design Certification**
- [ ] Basic HTML and HTML5
- [ ] Basic CSS
- [ ] Applied Visual Design
- [ ] Applied Accessibility
- [ ] Responsive Web Design Principles
- [ ] CSS Flexbox
- [ ] CSS Grid
- [ ] Responsive Web Design Projects
	
I'll be kicking this off likely next week to ensure that I'm set up for success and being able to dedicate time to this on a daily basis. Excited about what's to come!

### **THOUGHTS:**
So far, everything has been pretty good. I'm just getting going so hopefully I'll gain some speed with my progress over time. It's fun to learn for learning sake for once.

The HTML has felt like a breeze so far and is building off of things that I already knew from years of blogging, customizing my MySpace and Livejournal themes _(not kidding, who else got started with intro level HTML/CSS this way?!)_, and doing some light Wordpress development here and there, mostly fiddling with custom CSS.

The command line stuff I'm about to start is exciting since it's new and shiny to me. I've only ever used Terminal to run a python script or two to automate some processes at work so I'm excited to learn more about how that all works and how else I can leverage it in my day to day.
